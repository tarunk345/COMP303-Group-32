# COMP303-Group-32

Hi! Welcome to our project. We designed a maze-colesseum combat game, in which a player can collect armor, fight gladiators, explore themed rooms, and finish the maze by beating the Minotaur. The project was a product for a software design class at McGill University. 

Here are some images of our game:
